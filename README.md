## VTensor

VTensor, a C++ library, facilitates tensor manipulation on GPUs, emulating the python-numpy style for ease of use. 
It leverages RMM (RAPIDS Memory Manager) for efficient device memory management. 
The library integrates CuRand, CuBLAS, and CuSolver to support a wide range of operations, including mathematics, linear algebra, and random number generation.
